# R_Code_Youtube_Project
## Hello, this is my first personal project for data analysis using R programming langauge. The script is taking on how the dislike count is important to Youtube.
I used a dataset from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new?select=USvideos.csv 
that has youtube videos back when the dislike count could be seen. I was able to clean the dataset, 
removing repeating rows, and relist items based on a proportion of views to likes. I created this list under the column "interaction". I wanted to point 
out the necessary function of seeing the dislike count. Before the removal, To tell if the youtube video holds credibility a dislike count is used to give this feedback. 
(youtube would show a green bar for likes pushing against a red bar for dislikes with the total amount of likes to dislikes.)
I used to use proportion too distinguish reliable videos to fake videos(e.g. videos that made me feel uneasy or lead me in a wrongful direction). But now the dislike button is 
removed so I tried seeing if likes to views would give me any insight on the reliability of a youtube video.
